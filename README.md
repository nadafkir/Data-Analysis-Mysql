# **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project**

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset related to layoffs using advanced data manipulation techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The original dataset, `layoffs.csv`, serves as the primary source for this project.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identifying and removing duplicates.
   - Standardizing data to ensure consistency.
   - Handling missing values and data errors.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Converting date formats for improved usability.
   - Modifying data types as required for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Extracting key statistics such as maximum values, averages, and totals.
   - Identifying temporal and sectoral trends in layoffs.
   - Using SQL queries to generate insights into the most affected companies, industries, and periods.

## Key Insights
